<p>This page shows an easy way to get a numerical solution to the Inverse 
Laplace Transform of H(s). This method is useful for obtaining the time domain 
response of an analog filter, phase lock loop, power control circuit, and other 
types of control loops. </p>
<p>It shows delay times and settling times and allows you to see the overshoot 
and ringing caused by a pulse input. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span class="style15">A Low Pass Filter Example</span><br />
</strong>In general, low pass responses are the most important to us. In this 
example we use a low pass filter with a corner frequency (Fc) of 4 kHz.</p>
<p>The following is a screen shot from a MathCAD file which shows our definition of H(s) and its frequency response.</p>
<p class="style3">

<p>Next we show the how we obtain the pulse response for H(s). Note that 
the time span covered is defined in terms if Fc. We do this because the time 
span of interest is usually directly related to Fc. For example, if H(s) has a 1 
kHz&nbsp; bandwidth, there isn&#39;t anything interesting happening 
beyond 10 / Fc = 10 ms. </p>
<p><img alt="Fig 2" height="521" src="DILT/Fig%202.png" width="792" /></p>
<p>
It is important to note that while this method works fine for a pulse input, but 
it does not work for an infinitely long step response. The width of the pulse can 
be as wide as N T seconds, but beyond that this method fails. We show a plot of 
an infinitely long step response below.<br />
<br />
This method also works well for an impulse response. First set g = H(k) (i.e. 
stop multiplying H(k) by the Laplacian Pulse). Then set MaxFreq to 100 Fc and 
increase N. Then adjust the vertical scale on the time domain plot.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Although we used a low pass H(s) in this example, 
this method works well for high pass, band pass, and notch responses as well.<br />
<br />
We set MaxFreq to 10 Fc, but a wide range of values works fine. MaxFreq needs to 
be greater than about 5 Fc and less than N / PW. The size of the FFT can be 
almost any value, so long as the MaxFreq &lt; N / PW constraint is met.<br />
<br />
A way to validate this method is to observe that we can set the width of the 
pulse and see it drop at the correct time. Another way is to set H(s) to 1 and 
see the resulting square pulse output as shown here. </p>
<p>
<img alt="Fig 4" height="287" src="DILT/Fig%204.png" width="584" /></p>
<p>
As another validation of this method, we compare the results from this method to 
that obtained for an IIR filter. We use an IIR filter&#39;s response because 
obtaining its pulse response is trivial. The filter is a 4 pole Butterworth high 
pass. </p>
<p>
We offset the analog response on the x axis a bit for a better comparison. The 
Laplace pulse rises on the first grid line, and falls on the 5th grid line. This 
shows that the method described here can give a good estimate of waveforms that 
are rather complicated.</p>
