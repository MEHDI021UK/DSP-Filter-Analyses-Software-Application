<p>This page discusses Butterworth FIR, Chebyshev FIR, Bessel FIR, Gauss FIR, 
and Inverse Chebyshev FIR filters.</p>
<p>If done properly, almost any filter response can be implemented as an FIR. As
<a href="FIRFiltersByFreqSampling.html">detailed here</a>, one simply does an Inverse Fourier Transform on the filter&#39;s 
frequency response. The catch however, is 
that some filters will require an excessively large number of taps to implement 
(as we show below). </p>
<p>Here are 4 example polynomial FIR filters.</p>
<p>

<a href="FIR%20Analogs/256%20Tap%208%20Pole%20Elliptic%20LPF.txt">256 Tap 8 Pole 
Elliptic FIR Coefficients</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The filter responses shown above are worst case scenarios for FIR filter 
design in the sense that they all require a large number of taps to implement. Some polynomials 
however make excellent FIR filters. In particular, the Bessel, and Gauss polynomials create very useful FIR responses. 
The polynomials with zeros, such as the Inverse Chebyshev are the next best 
candidates for FIR prototypes, so long as the pole count isn&#39;t excessive. </p>
<p>In the next two plots we show the response of a Butterworth 
and Chebyshev FIR filter as the tap count is reduced. </p>
<p>
<img alt="Chebyshev FIR Plots.png" height="420" src="FIR%20Analogs/Chebyshev%20FIR.png" width="567" /></p>
<p>
<img alt="Butterworth FIR Plots.png" height="420" src="FIR%20Analogs/Butterworth%20FIR%20Plots.png" width="547" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are essentially two reasons why the Butterworth and Chebyshev make poor 
FIR prototypes. The first is the shape of the pass band. In particular, I am 
referring to the relatively sharp corner these two filters have at
ω = 0.2. Good FIR prototypes (i.e. those requiring the 
fewest taps), have a more relaxed corner as shown next where we compare a 
typical FIR response to a typical IIR response (emphasis on the word typical). 
In order to keep the tap count to a minimum, the FIR prototype must form a 
relatively large radius at the corner frequency. We will contradict this 
statement below, but this is essentially true.</p>
<p>
<img alt="FIR Filter and  IIR Filter Response Comparison" height="400" src="FIR%20IIR%20Comparison/FIR%20IIR%20Freq%20Response%20Comparison.png" width="522" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the problems with implementing a polynomial filter as an FIR 
is the filter&#39;s non-symmetric impulse response, as shown here. </p>
<p>
<img alt="FIR Filter and IIR Filter Impulse Response Comparison" height="400" src="FIR%20IIR%20Comparison/FIR%20IIR%20Impulse%20Comparison.png" width="542" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symmetry allows us to apply a window to the impulse response to reduce the 
sin(x)/x effects, which in turn improves the stop band performance, but symmetry is key. Without symmetry, 
a window such as the Kaiser cannot be used. Then the only way to minimize the side lobes is to use 
more taps, which is what we want to avoid.</p>
<p>The Butterworth and Chebyshev polynomials are poor prototypes 
for FIR filters. However, as we will show next, some polynomials do work 
reasonably well.</p>
<p class="style15">Gauss and Bessel FIR filters</p>
<p>Good FIR prototypes tend to form a large radius at the corner frequency. 
Gauss and Bessel filters take this to the extreme. Here we show the frequency 
response for a 12 pole Gauss filter. The 256 tap response shown here is a true 
Gaussian response. Notice how little the response changes by reducing the tap 
count to 20.</p>
<p>Also notice the group delay. If these were traditional FIR filters, the group delay 
would be&nbsp; (N-1)/2, or 127.5 and 9.5 respectively. We instead have the group delay 
typically associated with an IIR filter, and it is affected very little 
by tap count.</p>
<p>To be sure, nobody uses a Gauss or Bessel filter for their superb stop band 
performance. Rather, these filters are used when filter distortion must be kept 
to a minimum. Which is to say, little or no overshoot or ringing in the step response. The beauty of these FIR filters then is that 
these 12 pole filters can be implemented with fewer multiplies and adds than in 
an IIR structure, which is quite rare, and highly desirable, especially since 
the FIR can also be implemented using integer math.</p>
<p>Although we don&#39;t show it here, a 12 pole Bessel filter behaves similarly to 
this.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style15">Inverse Chebyshev FIR Filters &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Inverse Chebyshev is the only highly selective polynomial filter that 
works reasonably well as an FIR prototype. Here we compare an Inverse Chebyshev response to a more traditional 
Kaiser windowed response. As you can see, the Kaiser has somewhat better attenuation characteristics 
and because of its constant group delay, will distort the signal less. </p>

<p class="style15">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style15">Summary</p>
<p>In general, the polynomials used for analog and IIR filter design, 
such as the Butterworth, Chebyshev, Inverse Chebyshev, and Elliptic, are not 
good prototypes for FIR filters simply because of the tap count needed to 
implement them. </p>
<p>We explain the method used to generate FIR filters from these polynomials, or 
any other custom response, on our <a href="FIRFiltersByFreqSampling.html">
Frequency Sampling Method for FIR Design</a> page.</p>
<p>We included the Inverse Chebyshev and Adjustable Gauss prototypes in the
<a href="5FIRFiltersPage.html" >Iowa Hills FIR Filter Designer</a> (free) so 
that you can see the merits in trying to use an analog prototype for an FIR 
filter. </p>
