<p>Hilbert Phase is a term we coined. It is a method for calculating the linearity of phase. We call it Hilbert phase because it is the 
same method used to display the phase characteristics of a Hilbert Transform 
filter.</p>
<p>We have all seen the usual phase plots, and then ignored them, simply because 
it is virtually impossible to glean any useful information from them. As a 
result, we have been paying more attention to group delay plots which tell us 
how linear the phase is, and how long it takes for a signal to get through the 
device. Unfortunately however, group delay has units of time, not phase.<br />
<br />
Hilbert Phase shows how many degrees the phase is varying from perfect linear 
phase, and has units of phase. <br />
<br />
Here is an example of a Butterworth low pass filter where we show a standard 
phase plot and the group delay. The group delay shows us where the phase in non 
linear, but it is difficult to ascertain much more information than that from 
these plots.</p>
<p>

<p>Here we show this filter&#39;s unwrapped phase and draw a straight line to 
determine it&#39;s non linearity. The difference between the straight 
line and the unwrapped phase is the Hilbert Phase.</p>

<p class="style16">Calculation of Hilbert Phase</p>
<p>We use the same method of calculation 
that is used to display the phase characteristics of a Hilbert filter. To start, 
we need the Laplace transform for a time delayed signal.</p>
<p>
<img alt="LaplaceTimeDelay.png" height="44" src="Hilbert%20Phase/LaplaceTimeDelay.png" width="221" /></p>
<p>
To demonstrate the use of this Laplace operator, we use a linear phase FIR 
filter. We set &#39;-a&#39; to the filter&#39;s group delay. The resulting Hilbert Phase is 
a flat line because this filter&#39;s phase is linear. <br />
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Figure 1.png" src="Hilbert%20Phase/Figure%201.png" /></p>
<p>In this example we use an Inverse Chebyshev low pass filter. Its group delay 
is much less than the FIR filter shown above, so the impulse response moves back 
in time less. The original phase is not linear and the Hilbert phase shows us 
the amount of non linearity.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Fig 2.png" height="757" src="Hilbert%20Phase/Fig%202.png" width="631" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to interpret Hilbert Phase&nbsp;is shown here. As with 
the Laplace transform, the amount of delay used in the upper path is equivalent 
to the filter&#39;s group delay.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
<img alt="Hilbert Phase Diagram.png" src="Hilbert%20Phase/Hilbert%20Phase%20Diagram.png" /></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Here are two more examples of Hilbert Phase plots. The first is a specially 
designed 45 degree Hilbert filter. </p>
<p>
<img alt="Fig 4" height="330" src="Hilbert%20Phase/Fig%204.png" width="435" /></p>
<p>This shows a typical Hilbert Phase plot for an analog band pass filter. 
The group delay plot indicates that the phase isn&#39;t linear and the Hilbert 
Phase plot tells us the amount of deviation from linearity in degrees.</p>
<p>
<img alt="ButterworthBandPass HilbertPhase.png" src="Hilbert%20Phase/ButterworthBandPass%20HilbertPhase.png" /></p>
<p>In the Iowa Hills filter programs, we use Hilbert phase to show two distinct 
types of phase behavior.</p>
<p>For most filters, whether it be an opamp filter, IIR filter, RF filter, or an 
ordinary FIR filter, the Hilbert phase shows the amount of non linearity in the 
phase, just as in the Butterworth example above. The actual phase of the filter 
where the Hilbert phase is zero can be anything.</p>
<p>However, for filters such as a Differentiator or Hilbert Transform, the 
Hilbert Phase plot does not show a deviation from linearity, but rather the 
phase, adjusted for group delay. In other words, we show the phase results 
directly from the transfer function after the application of the Laplace delay 
operator.</p>
<p>These calculations are identical except that when we are only interested in 
nonlinearity, and not the absolute Hilbert phase value, we modify the results so 
that the Hilbert Phase starts at zero in the filter&#39;s pass band. As an example, 
if the filter has an inverted output, as some opamp filters have, then the 
absolute Hilbert phase would start at 180 degrees. Since we only want to show 
phase non linearity, we subtract out the 180 degree offset so the Hilbert phase 
plot starts at zero.</p>
