<p>Filter design was one of my specialties as an RF engineer. Now that I am 
retired, I work on these filter design programs when it is too cold in Iowa to 
ride bicycle. The programs are free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style12">Filter Design Programs</span><br />
<a href="5FIRFiltersPage.html">FIR Filters:</a>&nbsp; This FIR program synthesizes both Parks McClellan and Fourier filters (windowed). 
It is also capable of synthesizing filters from polynomials such as the Bessel 
and Inverse Chebyshev.</p>
<p><a href="4IIRFilterPage.html">IIR Filters:</a> 
This IIR filter program uses the Bilinear Transform method. It can synthesize 
filters up to 20 poles from all the classic polynomials, from the Gauss to the 
Elliptic.</p>
<p><a href="9RFFiltersPage.html" >RF Filters:</a> 
This RF Filter program synthesizes 
filters constructed of inductors, capacitors, and transmission lines. Its main 
focus is the synthesis of Direct Coupled and Norton Transformed band pass 
filters. </p>
<p><a href="6OpAmpFilterPage.html">OpAmp Filters:</a> 
This OpAmp filter program synthesizes VCVS and MFB all pole filters (not 
Elliptics or Inverse Chebyshevs). It synthesizes filters, up to 20 poles, from the Butterworth, Chebyshev, Bessel, 
Gauss, and Adjustable Gauss polynomials.</p>

<p><a href="A5HilbertPhasePage.html">Hilbert Filters:</a> 
(Special Phase Adjusted Filters) Band pass filters are unique in that we are 
able to set their phase to any value desired. Hilbert Transform filters are a 
classic example of this. This page starts with an explanation of Hilbert Phase, 
and then shows how the Hilbert Filter program can be used to design 
a number of special band pass filters.</p>
<p><a href="FilterPolynomials.html" >Filter 
Polynomials and Root Finder:</a> This utility programs generates the 2nd 
order filter coefficients needed for the design of OpAmp and IIR filters. The 
program also has a root finder capable of finding the roots of 90th order 
polynomials.</p>
<p><a href="8DownloadPage.html" >Download 
Page:</a>&nbsp; These programs are available here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style12">Filter Design Methods</span><br />
<a href="A4IIRBilinearTransform.html" >IIR Filter Design 
		Using the Bilinear Transform:</a> This page develops the equations used 
to generate IIR filters from the s domain coefficients of analog filters using 
the Bilinear Transform.</p>
<p><a href="FIRFiltersByFreqSampling.html">The FIR Frequency Sampling 
Method</a> This page shows a method for designing FIR filters by over sampling 
the frequency domain. It shows how to define a custom response (magnitude and 
phase) and also shows how to properly sample a filter polynomial, such as the 
Butterworth, to create an FIR filter. </p>
<p><a href="IIRChebyshevFilters.html">Chebyshev IIR Filters</a>,
<a href="IIRInverseChebyshevFilters.html">Inverse Chebyshev IIR Filters</a>, and
<a href="IIREllipticFilters.html">Elliptic IIR Filters</a> These pages show the 
merits in using these polynomials for IIR filters (as compared the Butterworth).</p>
<p><a href="B2PolynomialFIRFilters.html">FIR Filter Responses Using Polynomial 
Filters:</a> This page discusses using the polynomial filters, such as the Butterworth 
and Chebyshev, as prototypes in the design of FIR filters. </p>
<p><a href="A8FirIirDifferences.html">The Differences Between FIR and IIR 
Filters:</a> For those who are new to digital filters, this page describes some 
of the most important differences between FIR and IIR filters.</p>
<p><a href="7AdjustablePolyPage.html" >Adjustable 
Gauss Transitional Filter:</a> This page describes the Adjustable Gauss 
polynomial, a new transitional filter 
polynomial capable of generating a response anywhere between a Gaussian and Butterworth response.</p>
<p><a href="A6OpAmpFilterHelpFile.html" >OpAmp Filter Design 
Guidelines:</a> This page discusses various guidelines for designing op amp 
filters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style12">Example C Code for FIR and IIR Filters</span><br />
<a href="A7ExampleCodePage.html">FIR and IIR Filters:</a><span class="style14"> Th</span><strong><span class="style11">is 
page has code for synthesizing and implementing digital filters. Algorithms for </span> 
</strong>windowed and Parks McClellan FIR filters are given as well as the code 
for calculating IIR filter coefficients using the Bilinear Transform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style12">Smith Chart Program</span><br />
<a href="9SmithChartPage.html" >Smith 
Chart:</a> The Smith Chart is a classic tool for designing RF matching 
networks. This Smith Chart program also does bilateral matching with s 
parameters and has some built in tools for RF engineers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style12">Other Topics<br />
</span><a href="P51RootFinder.html">Polynomial Root Finder</a>: This page gives 
short description of the P51 root finder, as well as the source code. It is for 
polynomials with real coefficients, up to 100th order.</p>
<p><a href="A9DiscreteInverseLaPlace.html" >
Discrete Inverse Laplace Transform:</a>&nbsp; This 
is an easy method for obtaining the time domain response of H(s). </p>
<p>
<a href="B1GroupDelay.html" >Group 
Delay:</a>&nbsp; This discussion of group delay describes the effects of 
non linear phase. It also relates group delay to the amount of time needed for a 
signal to pass through a filter.</p>
