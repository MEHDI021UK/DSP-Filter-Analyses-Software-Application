<p>The Elliptic filter is the ultimate filter for narrow transition bands. These 
are as close to brick wall filters as can be made. These filters allow for the 
adjustment of both 
the pass band ripple and stop band attenuation as ways to decrease the 
transition bandwidth.</p>
<p>In the example below, the filter&#39;s pass band ripple is set to 0.001 dB and the 
attenuation is set to -80 dB. In theory, we could increase the ripple, and 
decrease the attenuation in order to sharpen the skirt even more, but this 
filter is at its limits. Elliptic filter design is limited by the proximity of 
the poles to the imaginary axis. Or more precisely, ones ability to control the 
pole&#39;s actual locations during the calculation of the poles, and their 
implementation. In other words, math errors limit us.</p>
<p>The free Iowa Hills IIR Filter Designer uses the algorithm described in: 
Elliptic Functions for Filter Design, H. J. Orchard and Alan N. Willson, IEEE 
Transactions on Circuits and Systems, April 1977. We modified the algorithm a 
bit, and are able to synthesize filters up to 15 poles, but above 8 poles, we 
need to restrict the ripple and attenuation levels. </p>
<p>Whether one can actually implement one of these will depend on the number of 
processor bits available. The filter shown here requires at least 24 bits to 
remain stable.</p>

<p>A good way to assess the Elliptic is to compare it to a Butterworth. 
Depending on the number of bits in the ADC, it may not be possible to get more 
than 65 dB of attenuation, so in this case, the Elliptic does the same task with 
6 poles as a 14 pole Butterworth. </p>

Elliptic 
filters up to 15 poles.</p>
