<p>This page describes the free Smith Chart impedance matching program from Iowa 
Hills Software.</p>
<p>See this page for a set of useful
<a href="Smith%20Chart/MatchingCircuitEquations.html" >matching 
circuit equations</a>.</p>
<p>Smith Charts allow the user to design impedance matching circuits. This is 
done by entering a load impedance on the chart, then altering that impedance 
with series and shunt components. This program allows for the following 
components to be used.</p>
<p>
		<img alt="Matching Elements.png" src="Smith%20Chart/Matching%20Elements.png"></p>
<p>You may choose to work with ideal components (no parasitics or loss), or you 
may specify the Q and parasitic reactance associated with your components. It is 
quite interesting to see the effects of the parasitics, even for the simplest of 
circuits. It is also nice to be able to adjust a component value 
after it has been placed. This can be done by selecting the text cell below the 
schematic symbol and using the arrow keys to modify the value.<p>The program was written for practical use. As such, the user must specify 
the tolerance for the capacitors and inductors which in turn specifies the 
discrete values used by the program. For example, if specifying 10% inductors, 
then the allowed inductor values go as 1.8, 2.2, 2.7, etc. You cannot place a 2.45673 nH inductor 
for example. The effect of using these discrete values is shown with the short 
changing color segments. For example, a segment drawn as green, dark green, green, dark green, etc. 
would represent 1.8, 2.2, 2.7, 3.3 etc. This gives the user a good sense of 
circuit's sensitivity.<p>The program can also plot S parameter data, along with their stability circles and 
the stability factor k. The user may match to S11 or S22 directly, or 
choose to match to the optimal bilateral matching impedance (if k &gt;= 1).
<p>&nbsp;
<p><span class="style10">An FAQ</span><br>A frequently asked question when getting started with the Smith Chart is: To match Z to 50 Ohms, do I start on the Smith Chart at Z, or Z conjugate?<p>
We start at Z, but a simple example shows an important aspect about these 
matches. Here we match a load of 75 - j100 to 50 Ohms at 1 GHz. 
Then on the right, we work through the problem in reverse to end up at the 
conjugate of our load.<p>
<img alt="Simple Imedance Match" src="Smith%20Chart/Simple%20Match.png"><p>This simple example shows a fundamental 
fact about circuits. If a circuit is designed for maximum power transfer, then you can break the circuit 
at any point and looking to the left you will see Z, and to the right you will 
see Z conjugate. If this isn't the case, maximum power transfer isn't occurring.<p>
&nbsp;<p class="style10">Q Circles<p>The program allows for Constant Q and
VSWR circles to be plotted on the chart. Q circles are used as a way to control 
the bandwidth of the match. The following example should make the point. 
<p>In the plots below we show two ways to 
match a load of 118 - j99.5 to 50 Ohms. In the first example, we 
draw a Q=1 circle on the Smith Chart. We then choose a circuit topology and 
component values that keeps the impedance traces within the Q Circle. Then we 
use a Q=6 circle, and do the same thing. Notice the effect on the bandwidth of 
the match.<p>It should ne noted that in general, these matching circuits are 
seldom this easy. It is more typically the case that the load being matched to 
is much further out on the Smith Chart. In other words, the Q of the load is 
high. In those situations, the bandwidth of the match is controlled by the load, 
not the matching circuit. The only way to improve the Q of the match (widen its 
bandwidth) is to add either shunt or series resistance to the match, which of 
course introduces losses.&nbsp;
<p>It is worth noting that a transformer traces out the same path on the Smith 
Chart as a Q Circle. VSWR 
circles can also be plotted on the chart, but they have little practical value 
in the design of a matching network.<p class="style14">Q=1 Match<p>
<img alt="Q Circle Example 1.png" src="Smith%20Chart/Q%20Circle%20Example%201.png"><p>
<span class="style14">Q=6 Match&nbsp; </span>This match uses values that push the impedance traces out to Q= 6. 
Note the narrower bandwidth of this match as shown by the return loss plot.<p>
<img alt="Q Circle Example 2.png" src="Smith%20Chart/Q%20Circle%20Example%202.png"></p>
<p>
Q circles show a fundamental fact about matching. It is usually the case that 
the engineer needs a broadband match, but to have a broadband match, we must 
stay within a low Q circle. Notice that if the load you are matching to is 
purely resistive, then it is possible to stay within an arbitrarily low Q 
circle, but you may need to use a large number of components to get back to 50 
Ohms.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if the load is highly reactive, 2 + j50 for example, then the 
load has a Q of 25, and it is impossible to do a lossless broadband match, no 
matter how many components you use.</p>
<p class="style10">
Bilateral Matching</p>
<p>
To start, let us make three points about this subject that need to be 
understood.</p>
<p>
1. Bilateral matching is done with 2 port s parameter data. This is typically 
done when designing the input and output matching circuits for a high frequency 
transistor. The transistor manufacturer typically supplies the s parameter data.</p>
<p>
2. Bilateral matching is only used for devices with |S12| &gt; 0. This is generally 
the case. The only 2 port devices with S12 = 0 are ideal isolators.</p>
<p>
3. If S12 = 0, then there is no path from port 2 to port 1, and the bilateral 
match reduces to a conjugate match. Or said a bit differently, if 
S12 for your device is very small, then bilateral matching isn't required and a 
simple conjugate match will suffice.</p>
<p>
The basic idea for bilateral matching is fairly simple. If S12
<span class="style11">&#8800;</span> 0, then there is a signal path from the output 
back to the input. The effect of this is that the device's input impedance is affected by 
the load, and the device's output impedance is affected by what is connected to it's input. Consequently, the only way to match such a device is to 
calculate the input and output matches simultaneously. We do this by using 
the device's s parameter data and the equations that follow.</p>
<p>
The following is a screen shot from a MathCAD file. The equations were taken 
from High Frequency Amplifiers by Ralph S Carson, Wiley and Sons, 1982. The 
final results are the variables Z1opt and Z2opt. These two variables can be a 
bit confusing. i.e. Are we calculating the impedance of the device, or the 
impedance the device wants to see.</p>
<p>
There is less confusion if one remembers that the outcome of these equations will yield a 
result fairly close to a simple conjugate match. So it helps to note their value 
relative the Z1 and Z2 as calculated from S11 and S22. The conjugate of Z1opt 
and Z2opt are relatively close Z1 and Z2. Thus, the conjugate of Z1opt and Z2opt 
represent the optimal impedance of the device itself. </p>
<p>
Consequently, if using a Smith 
Chart to calculate a matching network, start at the conjugate of Z1opt and Z2opt 
(start at the device, as always), and work toward 50 Ohms.</p>

8)</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Iowa Hills Smith Chart program will do these calculations. The user 
simply needs to read in an s parameter file, and specify the match frequency. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style10">Antenna Matching</p>
<p>Many people want to use a Smith Chart to design an input match to an antenna. 
Be warned however, this probably will not work.</p>
<p>If you use a network analyzer to measure an antenna's input impedance, you 
will notice that S11 can be made to move all over the place by moving an object 
around the antenna. This is a very good sign as it means that the antenna is 
well coupled to the atmosphere and any changes in the antennas surroundings, 
which also changes the amount of signal reflected back to the antenna, appear as 
a change in S11. Only very poor antennas are insensitive to their surroundings.</p>
<p>It has been my experience that good antennas are also very sensitive to their 
source impedance. Which is to say, a change in the source impedance also changes 
the impedance of the antenna. (Emphasis on the word &quot;experience&quot; here, I have no 
theory to back this statement.) The result of this is; there is not a good way 
to calculate a matching circuit for antennas.</p>
<p>It is certainly the case that some low frequency antennas use matching 
circuits, because they don't have a choice. To the best of my knowledge however, 
these circuits are either hand tuned, or tuned programmatically in the field, to 
minimize the reflected power.</p>
<p>An antenna is supposed to be the impedance matching circuit between 50 Ohms 
and 377 Ohms. If the antenna isn't presenting 50 Ohms to you, the problem should 
be fixed by modifying the antenna. A way to think about this is; if an antenna 
looks reactive, it is by definition storing energy, and this is the last thing 
you want an antenna to do as it will inevitably lead to losses. Low loss 
antennas look purely resistive. </p>
<p>In general, using an impedance matching circuit to fix an antenna's input 
impedance is a poor approach to take. The final result will likely be a very 
lossy antenna. Of course, in some situations, you don't have a choice in the 
matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style10">Miscellaneous Tools</p>
<p>A pad calculator, units converter, and free-space path loss calculator are 
built into the program, because it was easy to do and they are handy to have in 
the lab. Experienced engineers probably have the units and path loss conversions 
memorized, but the pad calculator is less trivial.</p>
<p>Calculating the resistor values for a pad isn't particularly difficult, but 
there are limitations the RF engineer must pay attention to if&nbsp; the load 
and source are to remain matched. The screen shot below illustrates this point. </p>
<p>In this example, we want a 3 dB pad between a 50 Ohm Source and a 75 Ohm 
load. As the program shows however, the minimum attenuation for this 
configuration is 4.0 dB if both the source and load are to remain matched. If we 
are willing to allow either the source or the load to be unmatched, then we can use an L pad as shown 
here. </p>
